I dream of a day, when a 5-year-old can run an AI model on his/her 15$ Raspberry Pi.

---

## What are we building?

I am building a **tiny** and **intelligent** language model.

---

## Why?

As builders, I believe we have a responsibility to empower the next generation with the tools they need to tinker and create. When I was growing up around the year 2000, my toolkit included things like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, motors, and Python code—affordable, accessible resources that made experimentation possible.

Today, AI is becoming an essential part of that toolkit. But most kids can’t pay for expensive APIs or buy powerful GPUs to run the latest models. If we want future innovators to thrive, we need to make these tools accessible to them—because one day, those kids will be the ones humanity depends on.

## How are we doing this?

I hope to achieve this with many experiments:

- Model pre-training
- Fine-tuning
- Merging
- Pruning
- And much more

**All codes, datasets, model weights, budgets are shared openly.** You can replicate/improve these experiments freely.

---

## Where does the money to do this come from?

Training language models are expensive:

- **OpenAI, Anthropic & Google** spends billions
- **Deepseek** spends millions  
- **The cheapest experiments** costs tens of thousands

### My Resources

I have been fortunate enough to receive a few GPU compute credits. Combined with my ability to abuse startup credits from AWS & Azure. I also have a 8-year-old 1050 Ti gaming GPU.

Combined with the ability to efficiently use compute, I have been able to fund these experiments.

## Is it even possible?

So far, most of intelligent models are large. A handful of small models have proven "kinda dumb". And all cost a lot of money and human resources.

**There's no guarantee of success.** I'm not doing this because it's easy. I do it because I believe it's important.
